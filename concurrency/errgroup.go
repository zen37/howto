The Go standard library follows a fairly strict backwards compatibility promise.
As a developer this is a good thing, because it means the packages there won't randomly change and break your code, but it has downsides.
The /x/ stands for external, and the packages inside it are still part of the Go project, but are external to the Go standard library. This allows the developers to follow a looser set of backwards compatbility guidelines on packages where the strict guidelines of the standard library don't make sense.
You can find more of these packages at https://golang.org/pkg/#subrepoâ€‹
Aside from needing to `go get` these packages, we can basically treat these packges as if they are part of the standard library
