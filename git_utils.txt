//5 steps to change GitHub default branch from master to main
https://stevenmortimer.com/5-steps-to-change-github-default-branch-from-master-to-main/

Step 1 - Move the ‘master’ branch to ‘main’
Run the following command which creates a branch called ‘main’ using the history from ‘master’. Using the argument -m will transfer all of the commit history on the ‘master’ branch to your new ‘main’ branch so nothing gets lost.

git branch -m master main

Step 2 - Push ‘main’ to remote repo
Remember that git is version control software on your local machine and GitHub is the remote server that stores your code. For this reason, you’ll have to push your new ‘main’ branch up to GitHub and tell the local branch to start tracking the remote branch with the same name.

git push -u origin main

//change the message of the most recent commit that has not been pushed to the remote repository
git commit --amend -m "New commit message."

//undoing the last commit
